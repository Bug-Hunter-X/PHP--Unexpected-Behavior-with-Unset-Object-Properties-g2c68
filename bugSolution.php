To reliably handle potentially unset object properties in PHP, always check for their existence before accessing them. There are several approaches:

**1. Null Coalescing Operator (`??`):**

This is the most concise approach. The `??` operator returns its left-hand operand if it's not `NULL`, otherwise it returns its right-hand operand:

```php
class User {
    public string $name;
    public ?string $email = null;
}

$user = new User();
$user->name = "John Doe";

echo "Email: " . ($user->email ?? 'Not provided'); // Safer way
```

**2. `isset()` Function:**

Use `isset()` to check if a property is set and not `NULL`:

```php
class User {
    public string $name;
    public ?string $email = null;
}

$user = new User();
$user->name = "John Doe";

if (isset($user->email)) {
    echo "Email: " . $user->email;
} else {
    echo "Email: Not provided";
}
```

**3. `property_exists()` Function:**

This function checks if a property exists in an object, regardless of its value (even if it's NULL):

```php
class User {
    public string $name;
    public ?string $email = null;
}

$user = new User();
$user->name = "John Doe";

if (property_exists($user, 'email')) {
    echo "Email: " . $user->email;
} else {
    echo "Email: Not provided";
}
```

These methods provide more robust and predictable handling of potentially unset properties, preventing unexpected errors and crashes in your PHP applications.
